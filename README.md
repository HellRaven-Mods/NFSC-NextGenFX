# OPUS-VANILLA-CustomVT
Shader-Mod for NFS Carbon

Hi Folks,
This is a shader mod that completely changes how the game Looks and feel.

**First of all, i want to give a Special thanks to everyone who helped me and set the base:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Xan/Tenjoin (decompiled shaders)
- BlueSkyWest (explaining some code)
- PAIN (some ideas)
- Good Shit (idea for Fixing flare-rotation direction)
- UNLOCALIZED (some ideas of how to fix certain szenarios)

**How to set-up the mod:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
!! You will either need XANs shaderloader (recommended for better usability) or Extended Customization 4.0.1 by Archie !!
!! when using EC4.0.1 you need to enable Custom shaders and compile FX files in the ini of EC !!

**Xan Shaderloader:** https://github.com/xan1242/xnfs-shaderloader-carbon/releases/tag/1.0

- create a folder named FX in game root directory
- copy files into that FX folder

**How to customize the mod:**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- open "visualtreamtent.fx" with VisualStudio/Code, NotePad+ or any Editor you want
- Change the values to your preferations
- (! IMPORTANT !) To see the changes you Need to go to Video Settings and Exit out again, that will reload the shaders

 !! DO NOT TOUCH THE OTHER FILES OR YOU ELSE YOU CAN BRAKE THE MOD !!
